<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I, Kelsey Archer Barnhill, am an Atmospheric and Envrionmental Sciences PhD Student at University of Edinburgh

<p>My PhD research, Cold-water Coral Reef Growth and Loss in a Changing Ocean, focuses on climate-change induced impacts to deep sea reef ecosystems.  Through using laboratory mesocosms to run year-long experiments on live corals and coral skeletons, my work will allow scientists to better understand physiological and structural responses of Lophelia pertusa to ocean acidification, warming, and deoxygenation. These results will be combined with ROV footage analysis quantifying the ratio of alive to dead corals to create carbonate budget models to predict reef futures in projected ocean scenarios.

    My research connects the work of iAtlantic to the Global Challenges Research Fundâ€™s One Ocean Hub.
